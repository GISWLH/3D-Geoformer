This project library is the open source code and datasets for the paper: "A self-attention-based neural network for three-dimensional multivariate modeling and its skillful ENSO predictions" by Zhou and Zhang.

The current project contains the 3D-Geoformer model code, pre-training code, transfer training code, and testing code.

The training and testing dataset can be found in https://datapid.cn/CSTR:33685.11.IOCAS.20221214.001

The multivarite prediction results during Jan1983-Dec2021 are listed in https://datapid.cn/CSTR:33685.11.IOCAS.20221214.001 for further study and comparisons.
