# Code_of_3D-Geoformer

The project contains the main code of the 3DGeoformer mdoel for manuscript review.

The current project only includes the code of model architecture, pre-training, trasfer-training,
and model test.

Due to the large size of the complete data, only a small amount of data is provided for model testing; 
the complete data will be provided later through the database link.
