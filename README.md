3DGeoformer model project library for Manuscript review and sharing ^-^

The current project only contains the 3D-Geoformer model code, pre-training code, transfer training code, and testing code.

The training and testing dataset can be found in DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.12157/IOCAS.20221213.001; CSTR: https://datapid.cn/CSTR:33685.11.IOCAS.20221214.001.

Finally, the complete project code and data will be published if the Manuscript passes the review.
