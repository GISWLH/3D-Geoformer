3DGeoformer model project library for Manuscript review and sharing ^-^

The current project only contains the 3DG model code, pre-training code, transfer training code, and testing code.

Due to the large size of the complete dataset, only a small amount of data is provided for model test; the whole dataset will be provided later through a database link.

Finally, the complete project code and data will be published if the Manuscript passes the review.
